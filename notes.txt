NOTES:

- i am adding features to the obj loader. it has to load materials too.
- associate each face with a material.
- you'll have to also load and parse the mtl



load mtl
have a hashmap from string to material
fill the hashmap with all the materials, string as key

if 'mtllib jifjoi.mtl'
    load mtl

if 'usemtl blabla'
set current mt to blabla
