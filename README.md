# Lucy's dx11 game

For now this is just to learn 3D rendering basics as I follow a [DirectX 11 book](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-3D-Game-Programming-DirectX/dp/1936420228)

# How to build

(Visual Studio and cmake need to be installed)

From a Developer Command Prompt for VS, `cd` to the repo folder and run...

```
mkdir build
build_shaders.bat
cd build
cmake ..
```

It should generate a Visual Studio solution by default.
